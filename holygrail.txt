Project Overview
Our system consists of two main components:

An ESP32-CAM module running as a WiFi access point and streaming JPEG images
A Python client that captures the stream and performs real-time OCR using Tesseract
Hardware Requirements
ESP32-CAM module (AI-Thinker model)
USB-TTL converter for programming
Power supply (5V)
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
Tesseract OCR
NumPy
Part 1: ESP32-CAM Server Implementation
Let’s break down the ESP32 code and understand its key components:

1. Initial Setup and Dependencies
#include <WebServer.h>
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <esp32cam.h>
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Wire.h>
These libraries provide:

WebServer: HTTP server functionality
WiFi: WiFi connectivity
esp32cam: Camera operations
SPI and Wire: Communication protocols
2. WiFi Configuration
const char* WIFI_SSID = "esp32cam_color";
const char* WIFI_PASS = "12345678";
The ESP32-CAM creates its own WiFi network (Access Point mode) instead of connecting to an existing one. This makes the system more portable and independent.

3. Resolution Settings
static auto loRes = esp32cam::Resolution::find(320, 240);
static auto midRes = esp32cam::Resolution::find(350, 530);
static auto hiRes = esp32cam::Resolution::find(800, 600);
We define three resolution options:

Low (320x240): For fast streaming
Mid (350x530): Balanced option
High (800x600): Better quality for OCR
4. Image Serving Function
void serveJpg() {
    auto frame = esp32cam::capture();
    if (frame == nullptr) {
        Serial.println("CAPTURE FAIL");
        server.send(503, "", "");
        return;
    }
    // ... frame sending code
}
This function:

Captures a frame from the camera
Checks for capture success
Sends the JPEG data to the client
5. Camera Configuration
void setup() {
    using namespace esp32cam;
    Config cfg;
    cfg.setPins(pins::AiThinker);
    cfg.setResolution(hiRes);
    cfg.setBufferCount(2);
    cfg.setJpeg(80);
}
Notable configurations:

Uses AI-Thinker pin configuration
Sets default resolution to high
Uses double buffering for smoother streaming
JPEG quality set to 80 (good balance of quality and size)
Part 2: Python Client with OCR
The Python client combines OpenCV for image processing with Tesseract for OCR:

1. Core Components
import cv2
import urllib.request
import numpy as np
import pytesseract
Each library serves a specific purpose:

cv2: Image processing and display
urllib: Fetching images from ESP32
numpy: Image data manipulation
pytesseract: OCR processing
2. Stream Processing
img_resp = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
imgnp = np.array(bytearray(img_resp.read()), dtype=np.uint8)
frame = cv2.imdecode(imgnp, -1)
This code:

Fetches JPEG data from ESP32
Converts it to a NumPy array
Decodes it into an OpenCV image
3. OCR Implementation
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(frame, config='--psm 6')
cv2.putText(frame, text, (10, 30), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
The OCR process:

Extracts text using Tesseract
Overlays the detected text on the video stream
Optimization Tips
Camera Settings

Adjust JPEG quality based on needs (higher for OCR, lower for faster streaming)
Use appropriate resolution for your use case
Enable double buffering for smoother streaming
OCR Performance

Pre-process images (contrast enhancement, noise reduction)
Use appropriate Tesseract PSM modes
Consider region of interest (ROI) selection
Network Performance

Use lower resolutions for faster streaming
Implement frame skipping if needed
Consider using HTTP/2 for better performance
